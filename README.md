AI-Powered Travel Planner
1. Project Overview
It is an AI-powered travel planning application designed to assist users in finding optimal travel options between a given source and destination. The system leverages LangChain and Google GenAI to process user inputs and generate various travel choices such as cab, train, bus, and flights, along with their estimated costs.
2. Objectives
Develop an AI application that efficiently fetches travel information.
Utilize LangChain to manage LLM-based interactions for user queries.
Integrate Google GenAI for intelligent data processing and response generation.
Ensure an intuitive user interface for seamless interaction.
3. System Architecture
3.1 Components
User Interface (UI): A web-based application interface to collect user input.
LangChain Framework: For managing LLM-based conversation flow.
Google GenAI Model: To generate intelligent travel recommendations.
3.2 Workflow
User inputs source and destination in the application.
The system processes the input using LangChain and Google GenAI.
The model generates a structured response containing different travel modes and their estimated prices.
The user receives the response with travel recommendations.
4. Tech Stack
